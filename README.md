The project titled **"Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network"** focuses on enhancing road safety by developing a system that can automatically detect and recognize traffic signs. This system is critical for driverless cars and autonomous systems, aiming to prevent accidents caused by missed traffic signs. It employs **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which process images of traffic signs captured by cameras, extracting features and classifying them into predefined categories. The project utilizes the **German Traffic Signs Dataset** consisting of 72 types of traffic signs and integrates residual blocks in the CNN architecture to improve feature extraction and accuracy. The proposed system runs on low-power devices for real-time use and can be fine-tuned for specific regional requirements, ensuring a flexible and adaptive driver assistance solution. 

The system also features a user-friendly graphical interface, created using Python's **Tkinter**, which allows users to upload traffic sign images and receive instant classification results. This project demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy and speed over previous models, making it suitable for real-world applications in autonomous driving and traffic management.
